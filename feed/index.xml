				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Return on equity = Net income ÷ Avg. shareholder equity</strong></p>
<p>Return on equity is also known as ROE and the formula above helps analysts to understand the earning ability of a company. Stockholders also use ROE formula along with other equations to determine the earning potential of investment.</p>
<h2>What is avg. shareholder equity in ROE formula</h2>
<p>As you can see the formula we discuss earlier contains a value for average shareholders’ equity in denominator. One can find the stockholders equity from the balance sheet of a company, by adding opening and closing balance of equity and dividing by two avg. shareholder equity can be calculated.</p>
<p>To calculate stockholder equity, use the formula below;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Stockholder equity = Assets – Liabilities</span></p>
<p>For calculating avg. shareholder equity one can find the opening assets and opening liabilities from balance sheet to get the opening stockholder equity. On the other side, use closing assets and closing liabilities to calculate closing shareholder equity. Shareholder equity is also commonly known as net assets.</p>
<h3>ROE vs. return on assets – How both are useful?</h3>
<p>Return on assets and return on equity are quite similar by name but there is a little difference in the approach of calculation. However, sometime little things can bring huge change and especially if we talk about little calculation errors which are entirely destroy decision making.</p>
<p>The value in denominator of ROE formula contains avg. shareholder equity while on the other side return on assets formula contains avg. total assets. Therefore, there is a huge difference in calculation techniques and so are the results. The calculation technique for average of both formulas is same as we discuss earlier and can be found from balance sheet of a company.</p>
<p>Although assets reported on balance sheet are calculated by adding stockholder’s equity and liabilities but ROE don’t use liabilities. While on the other side ROE also use the same technique however, return on equity formula does not use liabilities to calculate the values.</p>
<p>The return on equity can be useful both for internal and external purpose. One can use ROE with <u>capital yield</u>, <u>total stock return</u>, <u>dividend yield</u> and others.</p>
<h3>Return on Equity formula alternative</h3>
<p>There is another way also where you can calculate ROE;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>ROE = Profit margin × Equity multiplier × Asset turnover</em></span></p>
<p>If we look in to all above formulas separately then multiply all of them with each other. We will get the following equation in result;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">ROE = [Net income ÷ net sales] × [Total assets ÷ shareholder equity] × [Net sales ÷ total assets]</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">ROE = Net income ÷ shareholder equity</span></p>
<p>The result we get above is the same formula which is available on the top of this page. However, we can use both formulas according to your convenience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Doubling time with simple interest = 1 ÷ rate</strong></p>
<p>Doubling time for simple interest calculation is quite simple if compared to <u>compounded doubling time</u>. As you may know that doubling time is the amount of time required to double the investment. Similarly, doubling time for simple interest basically helps to determine the time required on an interest bearing account to double an investment.</p>
<p><u>Simple interest </u>is a type of interest where the investment or principle amount earns the profit. Contrary, <u>compound interest</u> is another type of approach where the principle along with interest from previous period collectively earns profit.</p>
<h2>How doubling time with simple interest rate formula induced</h2>
<p>To understand this concept first we have to look in the simple interest formula;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">S = P (1 + rt)</span></p>
<p>Adding the assumption of doubling the investment to above equation, and we get;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">2 = 1 + rt</span></p>
<p>Now if we subtract <strong><em>1</em></strong> from both sides of the equation, then we get;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">1 = rt</span></p>
<p>Because doubling time formula focuses on the time essentially, that’s why we can divide both sides with rate and get the results same as available on top of the page.</p>
<h3>Doubling time simple interest examples</h3>
<p>For example an individual has a simple interest account which is offering a rate of 9% per annum. The principle amount of $1,800 will be invested, the person wants to calculate the time after which he/she will be able to get $3,600 in the account. Now if we put the values in the formula to calculate doubling time simple interest then we will get;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Doubling time simple interest = (1 ÷ 0.09)</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">Doubling time simple rate = 11.11 years</span></p>
<p>Because, this is simple interest approach therefore principle amount do not affect the on the interest earned as opposed to compounding effect where principle amount changes each time. Here principle amount remains same throughout the tenure of the investment.</p>
<h3>Why there is a need for doubling time simple interest formula?</h3>
<p>Although <u>doubling time formula (compounded interest)</u> was already in place to calculate the investment doubling effect however, doubling time with simple interest is intended to calculate the figures where the simple interest is used.</p>
<p>The simple interest formula is commonly used to calculate the ending balance of an investment over a period of specific time;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">S = P(1 + rt)</span></p>
<p>As we need the ending balance twice of the initial investment, so we can rewrite the formula as;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">2 = 1 + rt</span></p>
<p>Now, if we subtract 1 from both sides of above equation, then we will get;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">1 = rt</span></p>
<p>Now, we will divide both sides by the rate <strong><em>r</em></strong> and in return we will get the equation available at the top of the page.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PV factor = 1 ÷ (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">r = rate of return<br />
n = number of periods</p>
<p>Present value factor formula is utilized commonly by investors and financial analysts to figure out the present value of money you have to receive in future.</p>
<p>Time value of cash is the basic idea behind the concept of present value factor. Time value of cash is the possibility that a sum of money got today will worth more compared to a similar sum available at a future date. Any sum of money available today can be easily moved to earn some extra money up to a specific time in future.</p>
<h2>Utilization of the Present Value Factor Formula</h2>
<p>By determining the present value today of an amount available at a future date, the equation for PV factor is then utilized to figure-up a sum bigger than available amount. To calculate this, a simple technique is used where the PV factor is multiplied with the amount available at the future date.</p>
<p>For instance, if Tim receives $700 in next 2 years with a rate of 12% then to calculate the present value of that amount at present date we will use the present value factor to multiply it with amount and rate also. The present value factor is normally available on a table that rundowns the factors influenced by rate (r) &amp; term (t) basis.</p>
<p>When you get the factor from the table then, you can simply multiply it by the given amount and get the present value of future figure. Utilizing the equation on the above example, the present value factor of 2 years and 12% is 0.797, so $700 multiplies with 0.797 equivalents to $557.9 in today money value.</p>
<h3>How present value factor formula is extrapolated</h3>
<p>Actual present value formula is further break down to get the equation for present value factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">PV = FV [1 ÷ (1 + r)<sup>n</sup>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">FV = future value</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">r = rate of return</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">n = number of periods</span></p>
<p>If you take out the FUTURE VALUE portion the remaining part of equation is the present value factor formula to calculate the PV.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total stock return = [ (P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>0</sub>) + D ] ÷ P<sub>0</sub></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">P<sub>0</sub> = Initial price of stock<br />
P<sub>1</sub> = Closing price of stock<br />
D = Dividends</p>
<p>Total stock return formula is used to calculate the gains or growth in the price of a stock and any dividends earned on investment. A share or stock can have only two types of growing or earnings patterns which includes either by dividends or by price increment. In the formula above the numerator value calculates the difference in price for the period (i.e. increase in price). On the other side denominator takes in to account the total return earned by the stock on the basis of original price (buying price).</p>
<h2>Calculating profit earned with stock return formula</h2>
<p>The formula for total stock return calculates the ROI in term of percentage. To convert the values in to cash terms a simple tweak is enough and you can do that by using the following equation. Although, percentage terms helps in quick comparison but some people like to look in the profit figures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Total return = (P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>0</sub>) + D</span></p>
<p>Let’s suppose, that an individual buy shares for $700 and after one year dividend paid for shares was $30 while the price of share at that time was $750. Now if we calculate the total return then it will be;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Total return = (750 – 700) + 30</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">= $80</span></p>
<h3>Total stock return formula example</h3>
<p>We will continue with the example we discussed earlier, where the initial price of stock was $700 and closing price for the period was $750 in addition to a dividend of $30 at the end of period. After putting values in the formula we get;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Total stock return = [ (750 – 700) + 30 ] ÷ 700</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">= 80 ÷ 700</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">= 11.43%</span></p>
<h3>Total stock return formula alternatives</h3>
<p>One can also calculate total stock return by using another mix of formula which include <u>dividend yield</u> and <u>capital gains yield</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total stock return = Dividend yield + Capital gains yield</strong></p>
<p>The above equation can be used as an alternate to calculate total stock return. It is derived by separating two values of the formula including stock appreciation and dividend. After separating both values we can then replace it in dividend yield and capital gain yield respectively. We can here represent the resultant value in both percentage term and mathematical figure term.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Risk premium = r<sub>a</sub> – r<sub>f</sub></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">r<sub>a</sub> = ROI or sometime assets<br />
r<sub>f</sub> = risk-free return</p>
<p>Risk premium formula is used to determine the return with a risk involving investment. Risk premium formula is sometime also simply referred as risk premium. Basically, risk premium is the amount which an investor would like to earn after taking a specific level of risk in an investment.</p>
<p>To get a risk-free rate a common practice is to use ‘T-Bill’ (US Treasury bill) for calculation purpose. On the other side theoretically, a risk free rate is that which involves no risk at all.</p>
<h2>Risk premium of the market</h2>
<p>To calculate risk premium of market risk free rate is deducted from average return on the market. In this concept ‘the market’ term in respect to stocks indicates towards the entire stocks index i.e. S&amp;P 500. The market risk premium formula can be show as;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Market Risk Premium = R<sub>m</sub> &#8211; R<sub>f</sub></span></p>
<p>Market risk is also referred as systematic risk. While on the other side, unsystematic risk indicates towards the risk linked with an investment but not related to market. Therefore diversification in investment portfolios helps to minimize the risks but to some extent only. The concept of diversification comes in when investors discovered the systematic and unsystematic risks and their relationship with returns.</p>
<h3>Calculating Stock Risk Premium using CAPM</h3>
<p>The risk premium of any investment can also be determined by using <u>capital asset pricing model</u>. In CAPM calculates the return by adding risk free return in beta times the difference between the market return and risk free return of investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">CAPM Return = r<sub>f </sub>+ β(r<sub>m</sub> – r<sub>f</sub>)</span></p>
<p>As stated earlier, that the difference in risk free investment return and return on market is known as market risk premium. So, the above formula can be restated as;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">CAPM Return = r<sub>f</sub> + β(Market Risk)</span></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CAPM = r<sub>f</sub> + β<sub>i</sub> (R<sub>m</sub> – R<sub>f</sub>)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">R<sub>f</sub> = risk free rate<br />
β<sub>i</sub> = Beta of investment<br />
R<sub>m</sub> = return of market</p>
<p>Capital asset pricing model is well known measure to calculate return on a share on the basis of risk. CAPM formula uses risk free rate of return and adds the beta times of difference in market and risk free rate in to it.</p>
<p>Another explanation for CAPM is that it describes the relationship between expected return on assets and systematic risk essentially for stocks. Capital asset pricing model is widely used to calculate the <u>cost of capital</u>, pricing of securities and as stated earlier for calculation of expected returns of assets.</p>
<h2>Relation of risk and capital asset pricing model &#8211; Explanation</h2>
<p>Every time a person makes an investment he wants compensation in return for taking a risk by giving his money in to the project. Moreover, time value of money is another thing which must be covered at the end of term to reach profitability.</p>
<p>In the formula <u>Beta</u> helps to calculate the level of risk an investment is going to contribute to the portfolio (i.e. shares pool). The β<sub>i</sub> value will be greater than 1 if the share is riskier than the market. On the other side if β<sub>i</sub> results in value less than 1 then it will reduce the risk of entire portfolio.</p>
<p>Market risk premium (R<sub>m</sub> – R<sub>f</sub>) is then multiplied with <em>beta</em> to calculate the expected return on the investment. Market risk premium is basically is the estimated incremental return to take incremental risk in comparison to risk free rate of return. After that risk-free rate is added to product of market risk premium and β<sub>i</sub> and result is the required return on investment or discount rate which can be used for other purposes also.</p>
<p>CAPM basically focuses on the question whether a stock is fairly valued and the risk and time value of money overweigh the expected return on not.</p>
<h3>Capital asset pricing model limitations</h3>
<p>CAPM contains a number of assumptions behind the concept which may or may not in-line with real world scenarios. Despite of these limitations it is widely used to compare several investments due to simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p>The <em><u>Beta</u></em> in the formula takes in to account the risk of share price volatility. But price volatility on upper side may not be as risky as towards the down side. Here the approach to work-back in history may not be helpful enough due to the fact that returns and risks are not generally distributed.</p>
<p>Moreover, another assumption underlying with CAPM is that risk-free rate of return will remain constant over the period of calculation. For example if we assume that interest rate with specific any specific bond increases over a period of time then CAPM will indicate profitability for that investment. But an increase in risk-free rate will directly influence the <u>cost of capital</u> and can simply make stock overvalued.</p>
<p>Market risk premium is calculated using any market portfolio and it is only a theoretical value moreover, it is not an asset which can be an alternative to the stock for investment purpose. Typically a popular stock index is used for market risk premium calculation like S&amp;P 500 and it may not provide a perfect comparison.</p>
<p>Another and most critical assumption behind CAPM is the estimation of future cash flows for discounting which may not be possible due to a number of factors. Moreover, if it is possible to estimate future cash flows precisely then essentially the need CAPM is completely diminished.</p>
<h3>How capital asset pricing model is useful for analysts</h3>
<p>After taking in to account the critiques and limitations inherit with CAPM it might not be possible to say to what extent the model is useful. However, it can be valuable in several aspects which include using it as a tool to estimate the fairness of future expectation or for comparison purpose.</p>
<p>For instance, if an investment manager is looking in to add a stock to his portfolio have a share price of $80. The CAPM is used to see price justification with a discounting rate of 11%. Now he must compare this rate of return with the performance history of the company to reach a reasonable return expectation.</p>
<p>Assume that manager discovers that performance of company during last 8-years shows stock was never giving more than 9% moreover, it also underperformed with 7% returns at instances. In such a scenario the investor must not consider investing in that option without any reasonable justification about expected rate of return.</p>
<p>Beside to all above some other financial ratios can also be used along with capital asset pricing model to evaluate the portfolio against the market. For example assume that your portfolio is giving a return of 9% per year since last two years with risk-free return of 7%. While on the other side the market average shows a return of 10% for last 2 years with risk-free return at 7%.</p>
<p>This analysis between market return and your investment could be helpful to reevaluate your portfolio performance. Moreover, such comparisons also help to decide which shares should be on the portfolio and which must be dropped out to maintain the profitability and risks also.</p>
<h3>CAPM Conclusion</h3>
<p>As stated earlier CAPM is typically used to evaluate if a stock is reasonably valued or not. However, a number of assumptions are inherited within this <em>Modern Portfolio Theory</em> about risk and return distribution, investor behavior, and other market realities which may not entirely exist in real world. But inspite of all these critiques it is very helpful to evaluate the reward against estimated risk to make decisions and compare available options.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bid Ask Spread = Ask price – Bid Price</strong></p>
<p>Bid ask spread formula is utilized to understand the difference between the asking price and bid price any specific investment. Moreover, the bid ask spread is primarily used for investments which sell on exchange however, it can be used for other investments too.</p>
<p>In other words one can also say that bid-ask spread is the amount difference with which the ask price exceeds the basic bid price for an asset in the market. Or the price difference between the buyer offer and seller demand for any specific item can also be called as bid-ask price.</p>
<h2>How bid ask spread is useful for investors or analysts</h2>
<p>Typically, bid ask spread is used to calculate the liquidity of a particular investment as we said earlier. If the trade volume is higher than bid-ask spread will be typically lower as compared with low trade volume. Bid ask spread is used to evaluate the possible price difference in both buyer demand and seller offer. By comparing the difference one can also estimate the potential of negotiations with seller. On the other side the assets may take longer to sale if price is too high or maybe there’s low demand for the product.</p>
<p>Bid-ask price spread use is very common for stocks, futures, currency exchanges and swaps because they are more liquid and can attract much buyer when available for sale as compared to other assets. In some scenarios, the bid-ask spread difference indicates towards the cost of buying a particular investment. More particularly when an intermediary (broker or agent) involves in the buying process and charge a fee. For instance, if a specialist is involved in the process of buying and he is selling on you behalf and also buy the same security. In that case, the spread will be consider as a profit for your broker, and it will be cost for 1<sup>st</sup> owner of security theoretically.</p>
<h3>Bid ask spread example</h3>
<p>Let’s suppose, that the bid price for a share is $37 while the seller is asking a price of $42 (ask price). Now if we calculate the bid-ask spread for the above case it will be $5. We can also report the difference in percentage form where it will use lower value from both selling or ask price. If we look at the above example then the lower value is $37 and spread is $5. We can calculate percentage as;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Bid ask spread = (5 ÷ 37) × 100</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Bid ask spread = 13.51%</span></p>
<p>The spread will go on the lower side if the buyer increase the bid or the seller decrease the price to make it close to buyer offer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Debt/Income Ratio = [debt payments ÷ gross income]</strong></p>
<p>Debt to income ratio tells about the financial position of a person where the load of debt is calculated on his/her monthly income. D/I ratio is commonly used by banks and lending institutions where they measure the capability of a person to return the borrowed amount.</p>
<p>Debt to income ratio is used for internal processing purpose by banks and lending institutions. Sometime people with finance background also refer debt/income ratio as backend ratio. Debt/income ratio is typically used when a person apply for a new mortgage or loan. An important point to not confuse back end ratio or total debt to income ratio with is housing debt ratio also known as front end ratio.</p>
<p>Measuring the capability of a person or company to operate in good financial position after loan approval is an essential part in any type of investment including stocks, bonds, etc. For banks and lending entities, giving loan to an individual or company is an investment. Therefore, financial institutions calculate the debt to income ratio to evaluate the profile of applicant and also to minimize the risk factor by assessing the debt load before approval.</p>
<h2>Debt to income vs. debt to limit ratio</h2>
<p>Debt to limit ratio is also commonly known as <u>credit utilization ratio</u> and is also sometime confused with debt to income ratio. However, debt to limit ratio is basically a measure of a borrower’s percentage available to use vs. the portion which is utilized by the person.</p>
<p>Debt/income ratio keeps an eye on your monthly debt payments in comparison to your monthly income. While on the other side <u>debt to limit ratio</u> compare your credit limit against the amount you are using from that limit approved by credit card companies.</p>
<h3>How managing debt to income ratio can be helpful</h3>
<p>Debt to income ratio is primarily used by consumer loans, auto loans, credit cards, mortgage, and other financial entities. Debt to income ratio basically tells about how much of monthly income % is going in to pay the debt payments.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that if your DTI is 18% then this means that 18% of your monthly gross income is going in to clear the debt payments every month. A higher Debt/income ratio indicates that an individual has too much debt and may not be able to meet his/her liabilities.</p>
<p>Generally, 43% debt-to-income ratio is the highest point where the applicant can still get an approval from a lender but not every lender. The ideal D/I ratio which lender love is 28-36 where 28 means that housing expense must not be more than 28% while on the other side debt-to-income ratio cannot go beyond 36% of gross monthly revenue.</p>
<p>All the expenses which are directly linked with your house are included in housing expense like property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, PMI, flood insurance, home owner’s association fees and more.</p>
<h3>How to decrease debt to income ratio</h3>
<p>To manage your debt to income ratio one opt for one of two available options. The respective person can either increase his/her monthly income so that if any lender calculates D/I ratio it fall under optimal slab. Another thing which can be done is to reduce the monthly debt payments either by paying-off the loans or by moving debt payments on lower side by increasing the tenure for loan i.e. from 3 years to 5 years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Current yield = [Annual coupons] ÷ [Current bond price]</span></strong></em></p>
<p>Current yield formula is utilized to determine the annual coupon payments relative to its current price. In other words current yield only take in to account the current price instead of face value or original value. While <u>bond equivalent yield</u> takes in to account the face value of a bond while calculating the return on such investments.</p>
<h2>How current yield formula is useful for investors</h2>
<p>As the name depicts current yield formula is used to calculate the yield from a bond by using its current price. Typically, <u>bond yield formula</u>, <u>Yield to call</u>, <u>yield to maturity</u> and some others yield equations are used along with current yield to evaluate the magnitude of returns.</p>
<p>In addition to all above some financial analysts use risk ratios along with yield calculations to determine a better option while comparing various bonds. The general rule for comparing is to rate different options according to risk rating and return. One will expect a higher return for a higher risk, similarly if two options are available at the same risks then an option with greater return will be preferred.</p>
<h3>Current yield formula example</h3>
<p>For instance, if a bond is offering a coupon of $120 on annual basis, and was issued at $1,100 then the current yield of this bond will be 10.9%. If this bond is currently selling at $950 at present time in the market due to either downfall in price or due to lower demand then the return would be different.</p>
<p>When we put the available values in the formula we get the results are;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Current yield formula = $120 ÷ $950</span></p>
<p>The result will be current yield at a rate of 12.63%</p>
<h3>Current yield vs. other yield formulas</h3>
<p>As it is stated earlier a number of bond yield formulas are used to calculate return on investment. However, as the name suggest current yield offers the return calculations based on current market price. While on the other side the bond yield or <u>equivalent yield formula</u> consider face value or original price of the bond to calculate return.</p>
<p>The yield to maturity ratio differs from current yield as it looks in to more depth than current yield and considers future inflows, increasing or decreasing price, face value and current price for calculation. However, on the other side current yield only look in to the current price of market to calculate yield which is much quick but not a deep analysis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Retention ratio = (Net income – dividends) ÷ Net income</strong></p>
<p>Retention ratio is also known as plowback ratio and it helps an investor, economist or financial analyst to find the percentage of earnings a company is holding for future growth. In this formula the net income is available at the income statement of a company. While calculations for retained earnings is carried out in the numerator when you subtract net income and dividends.</p>
<p>Retention ratio is considered as an important part of evaluation techniques where investor is looking into the growth perspective of a company along with other financial ratios. As we said earlier retention ratio basically focuses on the decision of company for amount kept as opposed to amount paid as dividend with a vision of future growth and investment. Financial analysts considers retained earnings as an opportunity cost of paying dividends for stockholders rather than to invest anywhere else.</p>
<p>Companies which have a higher retention ratio are typically considered as high growth opportunity investment in future. However, this doesn’t happens all the time as many external factors also influence the growth including economic conditions, stability of industry, market segments, competitors and more.</p>
<h3>Alternatives to retention ratio formula</h3>
<p>We can use <u>dividend payout ratio</u> as an alternative to retention ratio. We can subtract 1 from payout ratio the expression in result will be the retention ratio alternative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #808080;">Retention ratio = 1 – Payout ratio</span></p>
<p>Dividend Payout ratio is calculated by dividing total dividend paid by net income of the company. One can rearrange the equation to figure out the retention ratio plus payout ratio which is equal to 1 or 100%. When we move retention ratio to one side, the payout ratio goes to the other side with a negative sign with it.</p>
