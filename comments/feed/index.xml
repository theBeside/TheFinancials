Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is regarding the rewards program. I was promised upon signing up with att for tv/internet/phone service to receive a $300.00 gift/reward card. This was at the end of Sept 2018. Was told after making 3 payments they would send me my rewards card. In Jan &#039;19 a call was made to customer service informing them that the rewards card had yet to be received. Was told a card would be sent out and we should get it in about 14 days. Went on vacation in Feb and upon return checked all the mail and wouldn&#039;t you know it. NO CARD. Called customer service and was told the time had expired. Nothing they can do. How can something you never received suddenly expire. No help from customer service on THEIR error.]]></description>
